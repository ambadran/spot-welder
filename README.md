Battery Spot Welder Circuit Using Capactive Discharge (CD) Circuit

Using PIC16F628A and 16x2 display, a user-friendly interface is implemented

Three lines of capacitors (six in series) circuit act as the capacitor bank for HIGH
current discharge. They total to a <> Coloumbs.
They have an equivilant series resistance of <> milli-ohms
This means that at 24v they can deliver <> Amps!!!

Four VERY HIGH Power MOSFETs IRF3205 are put in parallel, capable of withstanding <> Amps through them
